### Testing
<li>I had a lot of trouble centering the images for the activities. Used flexbox as I did a bit of research and it seems to be the recomended way of positioning objects, but as that was a topic not covered in the course material I struggled a bit and it took a lot of trial and error. After trying a lot of different ways there was always a little bit more space on the right side of them until one evening I just thought to try "text-align: center" and it worked.
<li>Another thing I struggled with was positioning the hero image until I tried "background-size: cover" (the code for that I got from w3schools which I will include in resources)
<li>I wanted to add background to the pages but after a lot of struggles of sizing and positioning (I did manage to get it in place) I removed it as I thought it looks good as it is and I was getting pushed for time

### Validator Testing

I have left this error as my mentor said I should leave the action empty as I dont actually want the user to register and one of the requirements is for the user not to have to use the back button to get back to my website
